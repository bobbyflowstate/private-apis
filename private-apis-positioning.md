# Private APIs Companion — Messaging Drafts

## Core Pitch
Your own secure control panel for all the APIs you rely on. Stop juggling Postman tabs and half-finished scripts when you’re away from your desk—save each private endpoint once, add the secrets safely, and fire it off in a couple taps from your phone. It’s the power of a developer tool without the setup overhead, built just for your personal workflows.

## Alternate Takes
1. Carry your private APIs in your pocket. Store credentials safely, run the calls you need, and get clean responses wherever you are—no laptop, no scripts, just a tap.
2. From idea to API run in seconds: log in, pick the request, and let the app handle secrets, headers, and history. A reliable mobile cockpit for your custom endpoints.
3. Finally, a personal API console that isn’t chained to a desktop. Configure once, reuse forever, and keep your sensitive keys locked away while you trigger requests on the go.
4. Make your workflows portable: organize every bespoke API call in one secure app, cue them up with prompts, and see formatted results instantly, even on mobile.
5. Think “automation button” for your private APIs—installable on your phone, fortified with vault-grade secrets, and ready to execute the exact payloads you designed.
6. Your shortcuts hub for anything that speaks HTTP. Define the request, bind the secret, and launch it from a PWA that feels as comfortable as a native app.
